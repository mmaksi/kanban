👉 100% pixel-perfect development from Figma designs.
👉 100% responsive on all devices.
👉 100% score on Lighthouse and Page Insight in performance, accessibility, SEO and best practices.
👉 Loading speed = 1.2 second, which means better user experience and lower possibility for bounce rates.
👉 Total Blocking Time (TBT) = 500 milliseconds. The app was blocked from user interaction on first load only for 500 ms, which means excellent user experience in a world where users are expecting more from our digital products.
👉 Layout shift = 0. That means visual stability. Everything is rendered and loaded where they were intended to render. 
👉 100% custom CSS. No library used. My app not only performs efficiently, but also it was designed carefully. Every single styling property is crafted with care and with an eye for details.
